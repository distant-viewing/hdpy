This is the first notebook that we will be using this semester. The idea is just
to have something to show (hopefully! how easy it is to get up and running in
Python using Colab. In the cell below, run the expression:

```{python}
1 + 1
```



```{python}
mynum = 3 + 5
```


```{python}
mynum + 1
```


```{python}
import numpy as np
```
