## Introduction

In this text we have primarily worked with tabular data stored in
a CSV file. Tabular data is arranged into rows and columns, which
we went into further detail in Chap. 5.
As we have seen, this format is surprisingly flexible
while also keeping the data organized in a way that is 
optimized for using the grammar of graphics and data manipulation verbs to
do exploratory data analysis. Getting data organized for analysis
often takes significant time. In fact, it often takes us more time
than the analysis. Whether creating our own data or moving between formats,
collecting and organizing data is a time consuming, yet key, task. 

There are many other formats 
available for storing tabular datasets. We mentioned the use of
the Excel format in Chap. 5 as a good option for 
data entry and we used the special GeoJSON format for 
storing tabular data along with geospatial information. For 
most other common tabular data formats there is likely to be
at least one Python function or package that is able to read, and
in most cases write, tabular data stored in it. The **pandas**
library can load many variations on CSV, such as tables that use 
other delimiters or fixed-width columns. The **geopandas** library
that we used for GeoJSON will automatically read many
other spatial formats such as ESRI shapefiles. For formats
created by SAS, SPSS, or Stata, pandas has functions for getting 
the data into Python DataFrames [@haven]. If we have one or
more data tables in a database, packages such as **sqlalchemy** 
and database-specific libraries can query the database and return 
tables as pandas DataFrames [@duckdb] [@RMySQL]. For other
tabular data files that we may run into, searching Python's
package index (PyPI) will usually reveal a package that can help
get data into the desired format.

Sometimes, data will be available in a format that is not
initially organized into the kinds of tables we introduced in 
Chap. 1 and have used throughout this book. The most 
common types of non-tabular data that we may run into include
raw text, JSON (Javascript Object Notation), XML (Extensible
Markup Language), and HTML (HyperText Markup Language). All of
these can be loaded into Python using built-in functions and packages 
specifically designed to parse them. The challenge, however, is
that when read into Python these formats will be in the form of dictionaries,
lists, or other custom objects. Parsing these formats into a DataFrame
requires writing custom code that takes into account the specific
information stored in the data. Often this requires using new
functions or query languages, such as regular expressions or
XPath queries, to facilitate the conversion process. In this
chapter, we will introduce these four common formats and show
examples of how they can be used to represent different kinds of
information. Along the way, we show specific functions for 
parsing data stored in these file types. 

## Strings

The term *string* typically refers to a sequence of characters. We
have been using variables of string type throughout this book. 
We have used string variables in several different ways. First, as in
Chaps. 2-5, as categories to group, filter,
and summarize a dataset. There we treated the string
variables as coming from a fixed set of values (such as the name
of a region of the United States). In Chap. 5, we noted
that when creating data it is important to document and use a
consistent set of codes in order facilitate this kind of usage.
Another way that we have used strings are as labels or ids.
Here, typically, we expect each row of a dataset to have a unique
value for a specific variable and we use this value to label
points in a graphic. We used this approach in Chap. 2
in connection with geom_text layers and to link together
datasets through joins in Chap. 4. Identifiers also were
used through the application chapters to identify each document
in a textual corpus, nodes in the network data, and the images
in our image dataset. In the latter case, strings were also used to
indicate the file path where the actual images could be found
on our local machine. Another usage of strings came from the 
application in Chap. 6, where each string recorded 
long, free-form text that constituted the main object of study
in that chapter. We saw that working with the latter required
first pre-processing the data through an NLP pipeline to create
an annotation table with one row per token.

The case we consider here is where strings fall somewhere
in-between the free-form text in Chap. 6 and the
structured categories in the opening chapters. In other words, 
each string might contain structured data that needs to be
modified before we can use it in data summaries, visualizations,
and models. Understanding how to parse apart raw strings is a key
step in learning how to collect and organize large datasets. In
this and the following section, we will share several techniques
for manipulating strings that we will be able to put to use in
cleaning data in the subsequent chapters.

To illustrate the string manipulation functions presented here, 
we will again use a dataset created from Wikipedia related to
British authors. In the previous examples, we used a relatively
small set of 75 authors. Each of the authors was associated with
several metadata categories such as the years of birth and death
and a category describing the era in which they were active. We
created those records manually using the data entry methods 
described in Chap. 5. The metadata were stored as a
CSV file that we then read into Python and then joined with the dataset
that had the textual documents. Wikipedia has a much larger list
of authors that we could use to create a much larger set of
pages. As we will see below, creating the documents for this
larger set is relatively straightforward and just involves a 
longer loop through the set of pages. Grabbing the metadata for
each author, however, is a bit more challenging because we want
to try to do this automatically rather than entering the 
thousands of records manually. 

We have saved one of the intermediate steps in grabbing the 
larger set of Wikipedia pages as a text file, with one row for
each author. (We will show later how to generate this file.) We
can load this dataset into Python by reading the file line by line:

```{python}
# Read lines from file
with open("data/wiki_uk_long_meta.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    wiki = f.read().strip().split('\n')

# Show first 10 lines
for i in range(10):
    print(f"{i}: {wiki[i]}")
```

Already we see that there is quite a lot of interesting metadata
in this list. However, it is not sufficiently structured to 
immediately turn it into a tabular dataset with all of the 
features as individual columns. As a first step, we will create
a DataFrame that contains the text as its single column:

```{python}
wiki_df = pd.DataFrame({'desc': wiki})
wiki_df
```

In order to extract the structured information from this text,
we need to use specific functions for working with strings.
Python has excellent built-in string methods and the **re** module
for regular expressions. All string objects in Python have many
useful methods. For example, we can find the length of each string:

```{python}
# Add string length column
wiki_df['desc_len'] = wiki_df['desc'].str.len()
wiki_df[['desc', 'desc_len']]
```

There are also methods to extract substrings. Python uses zero-based indexing,
so the first character is at position 0. We can extract substrings using
slice notation:

```{python}
# Extract first three characters
wiki_df['desc_first_three'] = wiki_df['desc'].str[:3]
wiki_df[['desc', 'desc_first_three']]
```

We can also extract from the end of strings using negative indices:

```{python}
# Extract last three characters
wiki_df['desc_last_three'] = wiki_df['desc'].str[-3:]
wiki_df[['desc_last_three']]
```

There are many other useful string methods for searching and replacing:

```{python}
# Check if strings contain specific text
wiki_df['has_and'] = wiki_df['desc'].str.contains('and')

# Count occurrences
wiki_df['count_and'] = wiki_df['desc'].str.count('and')

# Replace text
wiki_df['desc_replaced'] = wiki_df['desc'].str.replace('ï', 'o')

wiki_df[['has_and', 'count_and', 'desc_replaced']]
```

These basic string methods are great building blocks for extracting text. However,
we need a more flexible approach to parse the Wikipedia data in our example.

## Regular Expressions

Python's **re** module provides powerful regular expression capabilities.
A *regular expression* is a way of describing patterns in strings. The
language of regular expressions can become quite complex; here
we will focus on a subset of components that are more frequently
used for cleaning data.

```{python}
import re

# Let's work with a sample of our data
sample_desc = wiki_df['desc'].iloc[0]
sample_desc
```

There are several special commands in a regular expression that
stand for sets of characters. A period `.` stands for any
character, `\w` for word characters (letters and numbers), and `\W` 
for non-word characters such as spaces. Putting any sequence of characters 
in square brackets will search for any matching character in the set. 
If the first term in the brackets is the caret `^`, this will instead 
match anything not in the set. There is also a special shorthand,
`[0-9]`, to match any digit. If we want to match one or more consecutive 
characters, we can use the plus sign (`+`). Let's see examples:

```{python}
# Extract patterns using pandas string methods with regex
wiki_sample = wiki_df.head(10).copy()

# Extract first word character
wiki_sample['first_word_char'] = wiki_sample['desc'].str.extract(r'(\w)', expand=False)

# Extract first sequence of word characters
wiki_sample['first_word'] = wiki_sample['desc'].str.extract(r'(\w+)', expand=False)

# Extract first sequence of digits
wiki_sample['first_numbers'] = wiki_sample['desc'].str.extract(r'([0-9]+)', expand=False)

# Extract first sequence of vowels
wiki_sample['first_vowels'] = wiki_sample['desc'].str.extract(r'([aeiou]+)', expand=False)

wiki_sample[['first_word', 'first_numbers', 'first_vowels']]
```

Two other special regular expression characters are `^` (start of string) 
and `$` (end of string). These are called *anchors* and can be very
useful for grabbing data within a string.

Now, we have enough tools to try to extract some of the data that
is captured inside of the string. To start, at least in the
first ten rows, if we extract all of the text up to the 
parenthesis, we will have the full name of each author. We can
do this by finding text that doesn't include parentheses:

```{python}
wiki_sample['author_name'] = wiki_sample['desc'].str.extract(r'([^(]+)', expand=False)
wiki_sample['author_name'] = wiki_sample['author_name'].str.strip()

wiki_sample[['author_name']]
```

What if we wanted to extract the last name of each author? This
could be useful to create a short name for future plots. We can do this by
finding word characters at the end of the author name:

```{python}
# Extract last names (last word before parentheses)
wiki_sample['last_name'] = wiki_sample['author_name'].str.extract(r'([\w.]+)$', expand=False)

wiki_sample[['author_name', 'last_name']]
```

Now, how about the dates that each author was alive? We can look for
four-digit numbers, which should correspond to years:

```{python}
# Extract birth and death years
# Find all four-digit numbers (years)
years_pattern = r'([0-9]{4})'

# Extract first and last occurrence of four-digit numbers
wiki_sample['birth_year'] = wiki_sample['desc'].str.extract(years_pattern, expand=False)
wiki_sample['death_year'] = wiki_sample['desc'].str.extractall(years_pattern).groupby(level=0)[0].last()

# Handle cases where birth and death years are the same
wiki_sample['is_modern'] = wiki_sample['death_year'].str[:2].isin(['19', '20'])
wiki_sample.loc[
    (wiki_sample['birth_year'] == wiki_sample['death_year']) & 
    (~wiki_sample['is_modern']), 'birth_year'
] = None
wiki_sample.loc[
    (wiki_sample['birth_year'] == wiki_sample['death_year']) & 
    (wiki_sample['is_modern']), 'death_year'
] = None

wiki_sample[['author_name', 'birth_year', 'death_year']]
```

We can also extract all occurrences of a pattern using `findall`:

```{python}
# Extract all vowels from each description
wiki_sample['all_vowels'] = wiki_sample['desc'].str.findall(r'[AEIOUaeiou]')

wiki_sample[['author_name', 'all_vowels']]
```

The output shows lists of vowels for each author. This type of structure
is called *nested* data. We can "explode" these lists to create multiple
rows per author:

```{python}
# Explode the vowels to create multiple rows
vowels_exploded = (wiki_sample[['author_name', 'all_vowels']]
    .explode('all_vowels')
    .dropna()
)

vowels_exploded
```

We can use similar techniques to extract professions. Let's look for text
after the closing parenthesis:

```{python}
wiki_sample['professions_raw'] = wiki_sample['desc'].str.extract(r'\)(.+)$', expand=False)

wiki_sample['professions_clean'] = (wiki_sample['professions_raw']
    .str.strip()
    .str.replace(' and ', ', ')
)

wiki_sample['professions'] = wiki_sample['professions_clean'].str.split(', ')

wiki_prof = (wiki_sample[['author_name', 'professions']]
    .explode('professions')
    .dropna()
    .reset_index(drop=True)
)

wiki_prof
```

Let's see the most common professions:

```{python}
profession_counts = (wiki_prof
    .groupby('professions')
    .size()
    .reset_index(name='count')
    .sort_values('count', ascending=False)
)

profession_counts
```

All of these top terms correspond to the professions we would
expect from dataset of authors. While a full cleaning would require
more sophisticated regular expressions to handle edge cases, our work
illustrates the application of regular expression functions
and how they can be used to extract data from raw strings.
As we can see, getting data organized is a time consuming process
and often the longest part of our humanities data work.

## JSON Data

The *JavaScript Object Notation* (JSON) is a popular open 
standard data format. It was originally designed for the
JavaScript language, but is supported in many programming
languages. The format of JSON closely resembles native data
structures found in Python. In part because of the
importance of JavaScript as a core programming language in 
modern browsers, JSON has become a very popular format for 
data storage. This is particularly true for data that are 
distributed over a web-based API, as we will see later in this
chapter. 

As with CSV, JSON data is stored in a plaintext format. This
means that we can open the file in any text editor and see the
data in a human-readable format. We created a small example of
a JSON file displaying information about two of the authors in
our Wikipedia dataset:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "name": "Charlotte Brontë",
      "age_at_death": 38,
      "date": {
        "born": "21 April 1816",
        "died": "31 March 1855"
      },
      "profession": [
        "novelist",
        "poet",
        "governess"
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "Virginia Woolf",
      "age_at_death": 59,
      "date": {
        "born": "25 January 1882",
        "died": "28 March 1941"
      },
      "profession": [
        "novelist",
        "essayist",
        "critic"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Data stored in the JSON format is highly structured. In some
ways, the format is more strict than CSV files and is relatively
easy to parse. Looking at the example above, we see many of the
basic element types of JSON data. In fact, there are only six
core data types available:

1. an empty value called `null`
2. a **number**
3. a **string**
4. a **Boolean** value equal to `true` or `false`
5. an **object** of named value pairs, with names equal to
strings and values equal to any other data type
6. an ordered **array** of objects coming from any other type

Objects are defined by curly braces and arrays are defined with
square brackets. The reason that JSON can become complex even
with these limited types is that, as in the example above, it is
possible to created nested structures using the object and array
types. To read a JSON object into Python, we can use the built-in
`json` module:

```{python}
import json

# Read JSON file
with open("data/author.json", "r") as f:
    obj_json = json.load(f)

print(f"Type: {type(obj_json)}")
print(f"Keys: {list(obj_json.keys())}")
```

The output object `obj_json` is a Python dictionary. In general,
Python turns JSON arrays into lists and objects into dictionaries. Numbers,
strings, and Boolean objects become the corresponding Python types. To create a structured dataset from
the output, we can use standard Python dictionary and list operations:

```{python}
# Extract author names
names = [author['name'] for author in obj_json['data']]
print(f"Author names: {names}")

# Create a DataFrame with author information
authors_data = []
for author in obj_json['data']:
    authors_data.append({
        'name': author['name'],
        'age_at_death': author['age_at_death'],
        'born': author['date']['born'],
        'died': author['date']['died']
    })

meta = pd.DataFrame(authors_data)
meta
```

The JSON object also associates each author with a set of 
professions. JSON naturally handles nested structures. To create 
a dataset mapping each author to all of their professions, we can 
use pandas' explode functionality:

```{python}
# Create professions dataset
prof_data = []
for author in obj_json['data']:
    name = author['name']
    for profession in author['profession']:
        prof_data.append({
            'name': name,
            'profession': profession
        })

prof = pd.DataFrame(prof_data)
print(prof)

# Alternative approach using pandas
authors_with_prof = pd.DataFrame([
    {
        'name': author['name'],
        'profession': author['profession']
    } for author in obj_json['data']
])

# Explode the professions
prof_alt = authors_with_prof.explode('profession').reset_index(drop=True)
prof_alt
```

It is often the case that one JSON file needs to be turned into
multiple tabular datasets with different primary and foreign keys
used to link them together. Deciding what tables to build and
how to link them together is the core task of turning JSON data
into tabular data. The difficulty of this varies greatly on the
level of nesting in the JSON data as well as the consistency 
from record to record.

## XML and HTML Formats

*Extensible Markup Language* (XML) is another popular format for
transferring and storing data. As with JSON data, the format is quite flexible and
typically results in nested, tree-like structures that require some
work to turn into a rectangular data format. Much of the formal
standards for XML are concerned with describing how other groups can
produce specific "extensible" dialects of XML that have consistent
names and structures to describe particular kinds of data. Popular
open examples include XML-RDF (Resource Description Framework) for
describing linked open data and XML-TEI (Text Encoding Initiative)
for providing context to textual data.

The XML format organizes data inside of hierarchically nested tags.
Below is an example of how the data from the previous JSON example 
could have been stored in an XML dataset:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<root>
  <author>
    <name>Charlotte Brontë</name>
    <life>
      <item name="born">21 April 1816</item>
      <item name="died">31 March 1855</item>
    </life>
    <ageatdeath>38</ageatdeath>
    <professions>
      <profession>novelist</profession>
      <profession>poet</profession>
      <profession>governess</profession>
    </professions>
  </author>
  <author>
    <name>Virginia Woolf</name>
    <life>
      <item name="born">25 January 1882</item>
      <item name="died">28 March 1941</item>
    </life>
    <ageatdeath>59</ageatdeath>
    <professions>
      <profession>novelist</profession>
      <profession>essayist</profession>
      <profession>critic</profession>
    </professions>
  </author>
</root>
```

Python provides several ways to parse XML. We can use the built-in
`xml.etree.ElementTree` module or the more powerful `lxml` library:

```{python}
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

# Parse XML file
tree = ET.parse("data/author.xml")
root = tree.getroot()

print(f"Root tag: {root.tag}")
print(f"Number of authors: {len(root.findall('author'))}")
```

We can extract data from XML by navigating the tree structure:

```{python}
# Extract author information
authors_xml = []
for author in root.findall('author'):
    name = author.find('name').text
    age = int(author.find('ageatdeath').text)
    
    # Extract birth and death dates
    life = author.find('life')
    born = life.find("item[@name='born']").text
    died = life.find("item[@name='died']").text
    
    authors_xml.append({
        'name': name,
        'age_at_death': age,
        'born': born,
        'died': died
    })

meta_xml = pd.DataFrame(authors_xml)
meta_xml
```

For professions, we need to handle multiple elements:

```{python}
# Extract professions
prof_xml = []
for author in root.findall('author'):
    name = author.find('name').text
    professions = author.find('professions')
    
    for prof in professions.findall('profession'):
        prof_xml.append({
            'name': name,
            'profession': prof.text
        })

prof_xml_df = pd.DataFrame(prof_xml)
prof_xml_df
```

**HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** is a markup language for describing 
documents intended to be shown in a web browser. While its primary purpose 
is not to store arbitrary data, we often need to extract data from HTML 
documents. Here's an example HTML file with the same author information:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <title>British Authors</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>British Authors</h1>
  <div class="author">
    <h1>Charlotte Brontë</h1>
    <div id="life" class="info">
      <p>Lived from <b id="born">21 April 1816</b> to <b id="died">31 March 1855</b>.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="profession" class="info box">
      <ul>
        <li><i>novelist</i></li>
        <li><i>poet</i></li>
        <li><i>governess</i></li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>
  <!-- Similar structure for Virginia Woolf -->
</body>
</html>
```

For HTML parsing, **BeautifulSoup** is the most popular Python library:

```{python}
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# Parse HTML file
with open("data/author.html", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    html_content = f.read()

soup = BeautifulSoup(html_content, 'html.parser')

print(f"Title: {soup.title.text}")
print(f"Number of author divs: {len(soup.find_all('div', class_='author'))}")
```

![Example display of the British authors HTML file shown in Firefox.](img/html_author_output.png){#fig-htmlauthor .lightbox}

We can extract information using BeautifulSoup's methods:

```{python}
# Extract author information from HTML
authors_html = []

for author_div in soup.find_all('div', class_='author'):
    # Get author name from h1 tag
    name = author_div.find('h1').text
    
    # Get birth and death dates
    life_div = author_div.find('div', id='life')
    born = life_div.find('b', id='born').text
    died = life_div.find('b', id='died').text
    
    authors_html.append({
        'name': name,
        'born': born,
        'died': died
    })

meta_html = pd.DataFrame(authors_html)
print(meta_html)

# Extract professions
prof_html = []
for author_div in soup.find_all('div', class_='author'):
    name = author_div.find('h1').text
    
    # Find profession list
    prof_ul = author_div.find('div', id='profession').find('ul')
    
    for li in prof_ul.find_all('li'):
        profession = li.find('i').text
        prof_html.append({
            'name': name,
            'profession': profession
        })

prof_html_df = pd.DataFrame(prof_html)
prof_html_df
```

## XPath with lxml

For more complex XML/HTML parsing, we can use XPath expressions with the
`lxml` library. XPath is a powerful query language for XML documents:

```{python}
from lxml import html, etree

# Parse HTML with lxml
with open("data/author.html", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    html_content = f.read()

doc = html.fromstring(html_content)

# XPath examples
# Find all bold tags
bold_texts = doc.xpath(".//b/text()")
print(f"Bold texts: {bold_texts}")

# Find all list items in profession divs
prof_items = doc.xpath(".//div[@id='profession']//li/i/text()")
print(f"Professions: {prof_items}")

# Find birth dates specifically
birth_dates = doc.xpath(".//b[@id='born']/text()")
print(f"Birth dates: {birth_dates}")
```

XPath provides very precise control over element selection:

```{python}
# More complex XPath queries
# Find all author names (h1 tags within author divs)
author_names = doc.xpath(".//div[@class='author']/h1/text()")
print(f"Author names: {author_names}")

# Find elements containing specific text
life_divs = doc.xpath(".//div[contains(@class, 'info')]")
print(f"Number of info divs: {len(life_divs)}")

# Combine XPath with iteration
for i, author_div in enumerate(doc.xpath(".//div[@class='author']")):
    name = author_div.xpath("./h1/text()")[0]
    born = author_div.xpath(".//b[@id='born']/text()")[0]
    print(f"Author {i+1}: {name} (born {born})")
```

## Using an API

An *application programming interface* (API) is a generic term
for a specific interface that two computers can communicate
across. Most commonly, APIs communicate over the internet
using the *Hypertext Transfer Protocol* (HTTP). HTTP
is a set of standards describing how different
computers can communicate with one another over the internet. It
is how the vast majority of the internet communicates; for
example, our web browser uses HTTP to communicate with other
websites.

There are many APIs available online for accessing a variety of
different types of data. Often these require first setting up
an account with the service. Some APIs require payment for each
request, though others offer free access or a free-tier of 
access for occasional users. Most frequently, data from an API
would correspond to some data source which is frequently
changing, such as news stories or the weather. Increasingly,
though, even static datasets are being put behind an API access
rather than allowing a straightforward download of a CSV, JSON,
or XML file. Fortunately, it is relatively easy to make and
parse API calls from within Python using the **requests** library.

We will show two types of API calls that can be made with the
MediaWiki API that runs behind Wikipedia. This API is particularly
nice because not only is it freely available, it does not require
any signup or access to run. Anyone can call the API directly
and get data related to the various MediaWiki projects:

```{python}
import requests
from urllib.parse import urlencode

# Build API URL for Wikipedia pageviews
base_url = "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php"
params = {
    'action': 'query',
    'format': 'json',
    'prop': 'pageviews',
    'titles': 'Emily Brontë'
}

# Make the API request
response = requests.get(base_url, params=params)
print(f"Status code: {response.status_code}")
print(f"URL: {response.url}")
```

Parse the JSON response:

```{python}
# Parse JSON response
data = response.json()

# Extract pageview data
pages = data['query']['pages']
page_id = list(pages.keys())[0]
pageviews = pages[page_id].get('pageviews', {})

# Convert to DataFrame
if pageviews:
    pageview_data = []
    for date, views in pageviews.items():
        pageview_data.append({
            'date': date,
            'views': views,
            'doc_id': 'Emily Brontë'
        })
    
    page_views_df = pd.DataFrame(pageview_data)
    print(page_views_df.head())
else:
    print("No pageview data available")
```

We can create a function to get pageviews for multiple authors:

```{python}
def get_pageviews(titles_list, max_requests=5):
    """Get pageviews for a list of Wikipedia page titles."""
    all_pageviews = []
    
    for i, title in enumerate(titles_list[:max_requests]):  # Limit for demo
        params = {
            'action': 'query',
            'format': 'json',
            'prop': 'pageviews',
            'titles': title
        }
        
        try:
            response = requests.get(base_url, params=params)
            data = response.json()
            
            pages = data['query']['pages']
            page_id = list(pages.keys())[0]
            pageviews = pages[page_id].get('pageviews', {})
            
            for date, views in pageviews.items():
                all_pageviews.append({
                    'doc_id': title,
                    'date': date,
                    'views': views
                })
                
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error fetching data for {title}: {e}")
    
    return pd.DataFrame(all_pageviews)

# Test with a few authors
authors = ['Emily Brontë', 'Charlotte Brontë', 'Virginia Woolf']
pageviews_df = get_pageviews(authors)
pageviews_df
```

We can also get the actual page content using a different API endpoint:

```{python}
# Get page content
def get_page_content(title):
    """Get the HTML content of a Wikipedia page."""
    params = {
        'action': 'parse',
        'format': 'json',
        'page': title,
        'redirects': True
    }
    
    response = requests.get(base_url, params=params)
    data = response.json()
    
    if 'parse' in data:
        html_content = data['parse']['text']['*']
        return html_content
    else:
        return None

# Get content for Emily Brontë
emily_html = get_page_content('Emily Brontë')

if emily_html:
    # Parse with BeautifulSoup
    soup = BeautifulSoup(emily_html, 'html.parser')
    
    # Extract paragraphs
    paragraphs = soup.find_all('p')
    print(f"Found {len(paragraphs)} paragraphs")
    
    # Show first paragraph
    if paragraphs:
        print(f"First paragraph: {paragraphs[0].get_text()[:200]}...")
    
    # Extract links
    links = soup.find_all('a', href=True)
    wiki_links = [link['href'] for link in links if link['href'].startswith('/wiki/')]
    print(f"\nFound {len(wiki_links)} internal Wikipedia links")
    print("First 10 links:")
    for link in wiki_links[:10]:
        print(f"  {link}")
```

This approach allows us to recreate the datasets used throughout
Chaps. 6-8. The specific query parameters for different APIs
will vary, but the general pattern remains the same: construct
the API URL, make the request, parse the response (usually JSON),
and convert to a structured format.

```{python}
# Example of building a larger dataset
def build_author_dataset(author_list, get_content=False):
    """Build a comprehensive dataset of author information."""
    dataset = []
    
    for author in author_list[:3]:  # Limit for demo
        print(f"Processing {author}...")
        
        # Get pageviews
        pageviews = get_pageviews([author], max_requests=1)
        
        # Get content if requested
        content = None
        if get_content:
            content = get_page_content(author)
        
        dataset.append({
            'author': author,
            'pageviews': pageviews,
            'content': content
        })
    
    return dataset

# Build dataset
authors = ['Emily Brontë', 'Charlotte Brontë', 'Virginia Woolf']
author_data = build_author_dataset(authors, get_content=True)

print(f"Built dataset for {len(author_data)} authors")
for i, author_info in enumerate(author_data):
    print(f"Author {i+1}: {author_info['author']}")
    print(f"  Pageviews records: {len(author_info['pageviews'])}")
    print(f"  Has content: {author_info['content'] is not None}")
```

## Extensions

There is a lot of information covered in this chapter and many
different directions that the material can be extended and 
built upon. Python provides excellent built-in support for regular
expressions through the **re** module, and there are many more
advanced pattern matching techniques worth learning [@goyvaerts2012regular].

**For string processing:**
- The **re** module has many more functions like `re.finditer()` for finding all matches with positions
- **pandas** string methods provide vectorized string operations
- Libraries like **fuzzywuzzy** for fuzzy string matching

**For JSON processing:**
- Python's built-in **json** module handles most use cases
- **jsonschema** for validating JSON structure
- **pandas.json_normalize()** for flattening nested JSON

**For XML/HTML processing:**
- **lxml** provides the most complete XPath support
- **BeautifulSoup** is excellent for HTML parsing and has a gentle learning curve
- **html5lib** for parsing real-world HTML that may not be well-formed
- **requests-html** combines requests with PyQuery for JavaScript-heavy sites

**For API interaction:**
- **requests** is the standard library for HTTP requests
- **httpx** for async HTTP requests
- **requests-cache** for caching API responses
- Authentication libraries for OAuth, API keys, etc.

Many resources exist for extending these methods. The **requests** 
documentation (docs.python-requests.org) is excellent for API work.
For XML/HTML processing, the BeautifulSoup documentation 
(beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io) and lxml documentation provide
comprehensive guides. When combined with the practical information
in this chapter, these resources should enable you to work with
almost any text-based data format or web API.

The benefits of Python's rich ecosystem make it possible to handle
complex data extraction tasks efficiently. Libraries like **scrapy**
for large-scale web scraping, **selenium** for JavaScript-heavy sites,
and **pandas** for data manipulation provide a complete toolkit for
gathering and organizing humanities data from diverse sources.

As we've seen throughout this chapter, collecting and organizing data
is time consuming and often requires careful attention to detail. However,
the tools and techniques covered here provide a solid foundation for
working with the wide variety of data formats encountered in digital
humanities research.
